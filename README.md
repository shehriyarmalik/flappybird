Clone of Flappy Bird game written on Flutter. Just my attempt to try out flame and flutter. Its a basic game replica utilizing only flame as a package. Flame is pretty easy to understand at a basic level and I would suggest watching tutorials on LANGAW which are in abundance on Youtube. Hopefully, I can better this skill and bring you more gaming apps in the future on Flutter. 

So, the code is pretty straight forwards, with quite flexibility on changing the background, pipe shapes, and even the bird icon. You can play around the project and come up with a new game altogether due to the flexbility of the project.
